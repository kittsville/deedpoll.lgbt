      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">This guide assumes you're over 16 and exclusively a UK citizen. Changing your name gets
        complicated if you have dual-citizenship.</p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Do I need a lawyer to change my name?</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">Nope. To change your name, you just need to a sign a document saying you've renounced your
        old name, in the presence of two non-family witnesses. This is called an <em>unenrolled deed poll</em> which 99%
        of organisations will accept.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Once you've printed and signed your deed poll you can can start contacting organisations to
        get your records updated. Ideally, you should start with legal ID, as this will make it easier to change your
        name with other organisations.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Are there restrictions on the name I can choose?</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">Technically the only restriction is that you can't change your name for fraudulent purposes.
        In practical terms further restrictions apply, as the UK Home Office <a
          href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/change-of-name-guidance/use-and-change-of-names#grounds-for-refusing-to-change-a-name-on-a-home-office-issued-document"
          rel="nofollow">won't issue a passport</a> if your name contains:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Numbers or symbols</li>
        <li>Punctuation marks other than hyphens or apostrophes</li>
        <li>Too many characters in forenames/surname to fit onto the face of the passport</li>
        <li>Language which may cause outrage or offence or are deliberately or inadvertently likely to offend sectors of
          the community</li>
        <li>Wording that promotes criminal activities</li>
        <li>A trademarked name, or is subject to copyright, except where the applicant produces written permission from
          the owner</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">While many businesses expect you to have both a first and last name, you can get a passport
        consisting of a single name (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mononymous_person"
          rel="nofollow">mononym</a>).</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You don't need to use the same name day-to-day as on official forms.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How do I decide on a name?</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">Try lots of different names and build a shortlist of your favourites. You can ask friends,
        partners and family for suggestions, though the final decision is <em>always</em> yours. Experiment with a new
        name for a week or two and see how you feel.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body"><a href="https://www.behindthename.com/">Behind the Name</a> is useful for understanding the
        history and meaning of a name.</p>

      <h3 id="what-next" class="govuk-heading-s">What should I do once I've changed my name?</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">Once you've changed your name you should start telling organisations to update their
        records with your new name. It's easiest to get organisations to comply if you have legal ID in your new name.</p>

      <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
        <li>Take a photo of your signed deed poll. Keep the photo safe and accessible via your phone</li>
        <li>Update your driving licence</li>
        <li>Update your bank details</li>
        <li>Download or print a bank statement in your new name</li>
        <li>Update your passport using your deed poll and bank statement</li>
        <li>Contact everyone else:
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Utility Companies</li>
            <li>Creditors, if you have any loans or credit cards</li>
            <li>The police, if you have a criminal record</li>
            <li>Your employer</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/tell-hmrc-change-of-details">HMRC</a>. Your employer will handle this if you are PAYE</li>
            <li>Loyalty Cards</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p class="govuk-body">If relevant, consider <a href="https://www.gov.uk/changing-passport-information/gender">
        updating the gender marker</a> on your passport at the same time. This will save you the cost of updating your
      passport twice. You can get a gender change letter from your GP, an NHS gender clinic or a private gender clinic.</p>

      <h3 id="gdpr" class="govuk-heading-s">An organisation won't change my name, what do?</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">Many organisations don't understand their obligations under GDPR's <a rel="nofollow"
          href="https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/your-right-to-get-your-data-corrected/">Right
          to Rectification</a>. Companies can ask for photo ID in your new name, but if they start asking for
        unreasonable documents or an enrolled deed poll then cite GDPR's Right to Rectification and send them the linked
        ICO guidance. If necessary, ask to speak to their Data Protection Officer. Even if the organisation is not based
        in the UK they still need to comply with GDPR when handling your data.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How do I change my title?</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">You don't need a deed poll to change your title and can start using a new one whenever you
        want.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">If you want to emphasise a gender change you could include your title in the <em>Old
          Name</em> and <em>New Name</em> fields e.g. <em>Mr</em> Martin Copperfields -> <em>Miss</em> Martha
        Copperfields

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Do I need to buy special document paper?</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">Nope. Your deed poll is valid on any paper. However, if you want to make your deed poll look
        fancy, try parchment or vellum paper with a thickness of around 100gsm.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Why did you make another deed poll website?</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">When I changed my name I used the fantastic <a
          href="https://freedeedpoll.org.uk/">freedeedpoll.org.uk</a>. At the time it used a server to
        generate the PDF, meaning your personal details got unnecessarily sent off your computer. A fix hadn't been
        completed yet, so I built this website as an alternative. Both websites are now equivalent.</p>

      <h3 id="privacy" class="govuk-heading-s">What is this website's privacy policy?</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">This website doesn't store or transmit any information about you. The deed poll is created
        locally, in your browser.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">This website doesn't use cookies, analytics or tracking pixels.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Can I suggest improvements or raise issues with this website?</h3>
