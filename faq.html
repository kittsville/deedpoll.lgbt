      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">This guide assumes you're over 16 and exclusively a UK citizen. Changing your name gets
        complicated if you have dual-citizenship.</p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Do I need a lawyer to change my name?</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">Nope. To change your name, you just need to a sign a document saying you've renounced your
        old name, in the presence of two non-family witnesses. This is called an <em>unenrolled deed poll</em> which 99%
        of organisations will accept.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Once you've printed and signed your deed poll you can can start contacting organisations to
        get your records updated. Ideally, you should start with your passport and driver's licence, as these will give
        you photo ID in your new name. Be sure to update your name with your bank and any creditors, to avoid being
        accused of fraud.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Are there restrictions on the name I can choose?</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">Technically the only restriction is that you can't change your name for fraudulent purposes.
        In practical terms further restrictions apply, as the UK Home Office <a
          href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/change-of-name-guidance/use-and-change-of-names#grounds-for-refusing-to-change-a-name-on-a-home-office-issued-document"
          rel="nofollow">won't issue a passport</a> if your name contains:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Numbers or symbols</li>
        <li>Punctuation marks other than hyphens or apostrophes</li>
        <li>Too many characters in forenames/surname to fit onto the face of the passport</li>
        <li>Language which may cause outrage or offence or are deliberately or inadvertently likely to offend sectors of
          the community</li>
        <li>Wording that promotes criminal activities</li>
        <li>A trademarked name, or is subject to copyright, except where the applicant produces written permission from
          the owner</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">While many businesses expect you to have both a first and last name, you can get a passport
        consisting of a single name (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mononymous_person"
          rel="nofollow">mononym</a>).</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You don't need to use the same name day-to-day as on official forms.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How do I decide on a name?</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">Try lots of different names and build a shortlist of your favourites. You can ask friends,
        partners and family for suggestions, though the final decision is <em>always</em> yours. Experiment with a new
        name for a week or two and see how you feel.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body"><a href="https://www.behindthename.com/">Behind the Name</a> is useful for understanding the
        history and meaning of a name.</p>

      <h3 id="gdpr" class="govuk-heading-s">An organisation won't change my name, what do?</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">Many organisations don't understand their obligations under GDPR's <a rel="nofollow"
          href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-rectification/">Right
          to Rectification</a>. Companies can ask for photo ID in your new name, but if they start asking for
        unreasonable documents or an enrolled deed poll then cite GDPR's Right to Rectification and send them the linked
        ICO guidance. If necessary, ask to speak to their Data Protection Officer. Even if the organisation is not based
        in the UK they still need to comply with GDPR when handling your data.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">How do I change my title?</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">You don't need a deed poll to change your title and can start using a new one whenever you
        want.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">If you want to emphasise a gender change you could include your title in the <em>Old
          Name</em> and <em>New Name</em> fields e.g. <em>Mr</em> Martin Copperfields -> <em>Miss</em> Martha
        Copperfields

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Do I need to buy special document paper?</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">Nope. Your deed poll is valid on any paper. However, if you want to make your deed poll look
        fancy, try parchment or vellum paper with a thickness of around 100gsm.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Why did you make another deed poll website?</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">When I changed my name I used the fantastic <a
          href="https://freedeedpoll.org.uk/">freedeedpoll.org.uk</a>. While it's a great website, it uses a server to
        generate the PDF, meaning your personal details get unnecessarily sent off your computer. The website's creator
        has been working on an alternative that doesn't do this, but it wasn't finished when I <a
          href="https://github.com/Dan-Q/freedeedpoll">last checked</a>. Some of my partners wanted to change their
        names, so I built this website instead.</p>

      <h3 id="privacy" class="govuk-heading-s">What is this website's privacy policy?</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">This website doesn't store or transmit any information about you. The deed poll is created
        locally, in your browser.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">This website doesn't use cookies, analytics or tracking pixels.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Can I suggest improvements or raise issues with this website?</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">Please do. This website is <a href="https://github.com/kittsville/deedpoll.lgbt">open
          source</a> and contributions are always welcome.</p>
